# Retroid Pocket 5 KLWP Theme
This a KWLP theme that I built for my Retroid Pocket 5. Will require KLWP Pro to import.

Put the included files into your /kustom folder on you device.

Set the SDPath Global Variable to your SD card path
`SDPath = /storage/####-####`

I utilized the Sofia Sans Semi Condensed in the theme. Download the ttf files and put into the /kustom/fonts folder
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sofia+Sans+Semi+Condensed

If you decide to utilize different fonts, you can change the following Global Variables to set the fonts in the theme
```
Font = Sofia Sans Semi Condensed
Font Lgt = Sofia Sans Semi Condensed Thin
FontBld = Sofia Sans Semi Condensed Bold
```

The weather icon used in the theme is Weather Or Not Outlines, which can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SDfeAWcp-qagMtuHrtMyrwqPETvu_M9L) and installed in your /kustom/icons folder.

Set the background to your own wallpaper image if you want. Also set the Wallpaper Blurred image to the same image.

I use ES-DE for my launcher so I put emphasis on that as the first icon. Feel free to edit it to your chosen launcher. Touch the game controller app icon to open the emulator apps section. You can customize the order you want in the Emulation Apps Group > Stack Group.
