# Retroid Pocket 5 KLWP Theme
This a KWLP theme that I built for my Retroid Pocket 5. Will require KLWP Pro to import. There are plenty of Global Varibles in the theme to customize the fonts and colors of many of the UI elements.

Put the included files into your /kustom folder on you device.

Set the SDPath Global Variable to your SD card path
`SDPath = /storage/####-####`

I utilized the Sofia Sans Semi Condensed in the theme. Download the ttf files and put into the /kustom/fonts folder
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sofia+Sans+Semi+Condensed

If you decide to utilize different fonts, you can change the following Global Variables to set the fonts in the theme
```
Font = Sofia Sans Semi Condensed
Font Lgt = Sofia Sans Semi Condensed Thin
FontBld = Sofia Sans Semi Condensed Bold
```

The weather icon used in the theme is Weather Or Not Outlines, which can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SDfeAWcp-qagMtuHrtMyrwqPETvu_M9L) and installed in your /kustom/icons folder.

Set the BG Global Variable to a wallpaper image that you want. I would suggest something darker and or not too busy.

I use ES-DE for my launcher so I put emphasis on that as the first icon. Feel free to edit it to your chosen launcher. Touch the game controller app icon to open the emulator apps section. You can customize the order you want in the Emulation Apps Group > Stack Group.
I also used a blank widget made with KWGT to keep any apps off the first screen. Normally you have to have at least one app or widget on the screen with teh default launcher.
